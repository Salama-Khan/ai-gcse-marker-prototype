2025-06-17T12:32:30.070387,Give two similarities between prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells.,idk,0,2,"It seems like you were unsure about the similarities between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Remember, both types of cells share some basic structures such as cytoplasm, cell membranes, DNA, and ribosomes.","When faced with a question you are unsure about, try to recall basic cell structures and functions that are common to all cells. This can help you make educated guesses even if you're not completely certain."
2025-06-17T12:32:50.461256,Name one type of cell that does not contain a nucleus.,rbc,1,1,"Well done! You correctly identified a type of cell that does not contain a nucleus. ""RBC"" is an acceptable abbreviation for red blood cell.",Always ensure that abbreviations are commonly accepted in the context of the exam to avoid any potential confusion.
2025-06-17T12:34:10.476629,Explain why muscle cells have more mitochondria than skin cells.,muscle cells require more energy than skin cells therefore they need to respire (aerobically) more as respiration releases energy. mitochondria is the site of respiration,3,3,"Great job! You clearly explained why muscle cells have more mitochondria than skin cells by mentioning the need for more energy, the role of aerobic respiration, and the function of mitochondria.","When explaining biological processes, always ensure to link the function to the structure or organelle involved, as you did here with mitochondria and respiration."
2025-06-17T12:41:36.463452,Give two similarities between prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells.,lljsnaa,0,2,The answer provided does not contain any recognizable information related to the similarities between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Please ensure that your response includes specific biological terms that relate to the question.,"When answering questions about similarities or differences, focus on key biological structures or functions that are commonly discussed in your studies. Use precise terminology to clearly convey your understanding."
2025-06-17T14:23:36.760779,Compare the structure of a red blood cell with the structure of a plant cell.,red blood cell is red but plant is any colour,0,6,"Your answer does not address the structural differences or similarities between a red blood cell and a plant cell. Focus on comparing specific features such as the presence of a nucleus, cell wall, chloroplasts, and other organelles.","When asked to compare structures, list specific features of each type of cell and highlight both differences and similarities. This will help you cover all necessary points for full marks."
2025-06-17T14:55:05.135156,Explain why root hair cells contain mitochondria.,cause it needs energy and mitochondria is where respiration takes place respiration releases energy which is used for active transport,3,4,"Your answer correctly identifies that mitochondria are involved in respiration and that this process releases energy for active transport. However, you did not mention that this energy is used to transport ions against a concentration gradient or from a low to high concentration. Including this detail would have earned you full marks.","When explaining biological processes, try to include all relevant details, such as the direction of movement in active transport, to ensure you cover all aspects of the mark scheme."
