# AI GCSE Biology Marker (Streamlit Prototype)

Prompt-engineering prototype that scores short student answers against an exam board mark scheme and returns:
- **awarded_mark / max_mark**
- **structured feedback** (what was correct/missed)
- **exam tip** (how to approach next time)

> Status: prototype. Streamlit app + prompt-engineered backend.

## What’s here
- `streamlit prototype/` — Streamlit UI and logic (prototype)
- `.devcontainer/` — dev container config
- `test/` — tests or scratch cases
- `requirements.txt` — Python deps

## Next steps
- Flatten folders and set a clean entrypoint (`app/app.py`)
- Add `.env.example` and config
- Add small evaluation harness
